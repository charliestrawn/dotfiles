# dotfiles

This is my configuration for macOS systems. At some point I'd like to update it to work on general unix systems, or at least support Debian flavors.

Things this repo sets up.

- oh-my-zsh with powerlevel 10k theme
- [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and installs packages I use frequently
- vim (well, neovim) and plugins
- aliases and functions
- Python virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper (typically the only things I try to keep in system pip)

### TODO

- [] gitconfig
- [] iterm settings
- [] vscode settings?
- [] editorconfig or jetbrains config
- [] linux support
